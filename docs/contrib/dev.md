All the development happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/dmerejkowsky/tsrc).

# Suggesting changes

You are free to open a pull request for anything you want to change on `tsrc`.

In particular, pull requests that implement a prototype for a new
feature are welcome, having "real code" to look at can provide useful
insight, even if the code is not merged after all.

That being said, if you want your pull request to be merged, we'll
ask that:

* The code follows the indications from the [code manifesto](../code-manifesto.md)
* All existing linters pass
* All existing tests run
* The new feature comes with appropriate tests
* The Git History is easy to review

See the [GitHub actions workflows](https://github.com/dmerejkowsky/tsrc/blob/main/.github/workflows)
to see what exactly what commands are run and the Python versions we
support.

Also, if relevant, you will need to:

* update the changelog (in `docs/changelog.md`)
* update the documentation if required


Finally, feel free to add your name in the `THANKS` file ;)
